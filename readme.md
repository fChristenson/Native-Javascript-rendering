# Native Javascript rendering

## What we will cover

* My old native rendering approach
* The approach that made me rethink my own method

## Notes

The other day I was reading an article that showed
me a creative use for Javascript's template literals
that I have seen a few times but never tried.

So I thought, let's try it out and see if there are any
clear benefits over my old method.

So I did a few basic tests and to my suprise the only
downside I could find was that it is not supported in
old browsers.

## Conclusion

With template literals I seem to get less boilerplate,
a better overview of the elements structure and slightly
better performance.

This is GREAT and I couldn't be happier!
Well, if the support was as great as for
`createElement` I couldn't be happier, but still.
